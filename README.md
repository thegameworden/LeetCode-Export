# LeetCode-Export

This program's purpose is to download the first accepted LeetCode submission for all the questions that you have answered, provide an overview of your LeetCode ranking, as well as provide details for all the LeetCode contests that you have attended.

REQUIREMENT: You must have Google Chrome installed. As of now the code creates a popup through Google Chrome only. 

You can view the example output using my LeetCode Profile <a href="https://github.com/thegameworden/LeetCode-Answers">HERE</a>

You can try it out by downloading it here: [LeetCode-Export.zip](https://github.com/thegameworden/LeetCode-Export/files/11247238/LeetCode-Export.zip)
